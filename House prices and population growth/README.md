# House prices and population growth

The projectâ€™s objective is to understand how the housing prices have varied in the United State from 1975 to 2018 and to understand if the house prices are changing in relation to
1. House prices over time
2. Change in house prices for varying population density
3. Change in house prices for changing population

# Conclusions
Although there has been a significant rise and drop in the prices over the years, the average house prices of the US have increased over the years. The District of Columbia has seen the biggest increase in real house prices while West Virginia has the biggest decrease. Most states follow a similar increase and decrease trend except North Dakota which follows a concave-shaped trend, and the price increase in states in the Northeast and West Region saw a higher increase in prices in comparison to the remaining two regions.
Further, we saw that the changes in house prices are affected by the change in population density. Even when the outliers, District of Columbia were removed, the change in average prices still showed an increasing trend with an increase in population density. When compared amongst the region, except the Midwest region, the rest of the regions have increased average prices trend with increase in population density.
Then, we saw that with the change in population, the house prices stayed almost the same for the South and the West region, while it increased slightly for the Northeast region and increased for the Midwest. For the 2000-2010 period, except the Midwest, the rest of the regions saw a fall in house prices, with the West having the biggest fall. The average house prices increased the most for the West region the most for the 2010-2018 period, followed by the South, and almost stayed the same for the Northeast region and dropped hugely for the Midwest.
Though most of the observations seem reasonable, the huge fall in the house prices of the Midwestern region as the population increases for the 2010-2018 time does not seem ordinary, considering that the housing prices are constantly increasing throughout the US since 2013.
